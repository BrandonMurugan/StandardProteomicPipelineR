- filter proteingroups file, removing cotam and rev hits
- extract leading proteins to make proteinn  list
- filter peptides file, removing cotam and rev hits
- use protein list to filter peptides file and link each protein with its peptides
- calculate the ratio between Control and Treatment for each peptide within each protein
- discard peptides that do not conform to the same FC sign (neg or pos) as the majority for each protein group:
  if there is < 75% agreement, discard protein
- calculate new protein quant value for each protein using remaining peptides (sum)
- use new quant values for DE anaysis using LIMMA/t-test/RankProd

(?) normalise peptides before protein assignment or normalise proteins after
